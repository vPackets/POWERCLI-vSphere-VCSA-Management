### Introduction ###

I had a need to automate my NSX-T lab deployment. I could have used a single tool to perform all the relevant task but I wanted to learn and will use multiple scripts and tools.
_*This particular repository uses Powershell and Powercli. This is my first time using Powercli and Powershell hence the code is ugly and I just wanted to learn all the syntax that the code was expecting.*_

The goal is to create a vds on 3 hosts that are part of multiple cluster (management and compute).

In a later release, I will optimize the code in a much better way and introduce loops.


### Prerequisites ###

I have used [my own docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vpackets/tools) - ([Source code](https://github.com/vPackets/DOCKER-Tools))  to run this particular repository.
It contains all the libraries and software I need to accomplish my day to day job.

I am using Powershell version 7.0.3 with Powercli automatically installed by pwsh during the container creation.


### Version Used ###

```
Ubuntu Version :        18.04.3 LTS 
Powershell:             7.0.3
VCSA OVA:               7.0.0.10300-16189094

```


### Software Requirements #

none



### Code architecture ###

```
|-- README.md
|-- assign_dvuplink.ps1
`-- vds_creation.ps1
```

I wanted to have something flexible so that I could test a single playbook without impacting the code on other playbooks.
Deploy.yml is the main playbook to run. It will call each playbooks in order.

```
- import_playbook: playbooks/00-deploy-vcsa.yml
- import_playbook: playbooks/01-basic-config-vcsa.yml
- import_playbook: playbooks/02-add-hosts.yml
- import_playbook: playbooks/03-storage.yml
```


#### Code Execution ####

Open vds_creation.ps1 and execute the commands 


#### TO DO ####

    - General code improvement ... Current code not suitable for production - Used as a learning tool only
    - Loops, Variable definition ....
